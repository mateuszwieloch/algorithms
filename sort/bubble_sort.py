    Start from the left and "bubble up" big values by comparing consecutive
    pairs (sliding window). If values in a pair and in a wrong order, swap.

    Each "bubble up" iteration, accumulates one more sorted value on the right
    of the array.

    An additional optimization included in the code is early termination of the
    algorithm if no swaps are performed in an iteration, because it means the
    array has already been sorted.
